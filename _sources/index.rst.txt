Documentation example
=====================

This document demonstrates the out-of-code documentation, which is perfect for the example-first documentation style.

Some important topic
====================

When needed, different parts of the API can be pulled in as references:

.. doxygenfunction:: function

We can pull in parts of the code as examples:

.. literalinclude:: main.cc
   :language: cpp
   :start-line: 4
   :end-line: 7
